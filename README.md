## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

It is admirable that we are interested in the subject of medical expenditures in the USA because it is a significant problem that millions of Americans face. In the United States, healthcare costs are among the highest in the world and they keep going up. Many people are now struggling to pay for medical services and treatments even with health insurance, which has led to financial hardships for many of them. The high expense of healthcare may discourage people from receiving the necessary medical care, making health issues worse and more expensive to address. Additionally, the economic burden of the high cost of healthcare makes it challenging for people and businesses to afford essential medical services.

In addition, everyone is affected by the problem of medical bills, regardless of age, money, or social standing. People are finding it more difficult to receive high-quality medical care as a result of rising healthcare costs, endangering their health and wellbeing. So, tackling the problem of medical prices is essential if we want to guarantee that everyone has access to high-quality, reasonably priced healthcare. This can be accomplished through adopting new technologies to save costs and enhance access to medical services, together with changing policies and boosting competition in the healthcare sector.

In conclusion, the problem of medical costs in the United States is a significant issue that merits discussion. We can strive toward a time when everyone has access to high-quality, affordable healthcare by tackling this issue.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset gives us an in-depth look into the medical expenditures in the United States between the years 2013 and 2017. It includes information on how much was spent in total, how much was spent per person, and what percentage of the country's total economic output was dedicated to healthcare. The data is broken down into categories such as hospital care, doctor and clinic services, and drug purchases at the pharmacy.

One of the highlights of this dataset is the information it provides on where the money for medical expenditures came from. For instance, it delves into spending funded by private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. This comprehensive look into the funding of healthcare in the US gives us a much better understanding of the overall financial landscape.

Another useful feature of this dataset is that it is divided by state, allowing for analysis of spending patterns across different areas of the country. This information is particularly useful for healthcare analysts and policy makers who are interested in understanding the current state of healthcare in different regions of the US.

In conclusion, this dataset provides us with a wealth of information about the cost of healthcare in the US. By tracking spending trends over a period of five years, it gives us a clear picture of how much is being spent, where the money is coming from, and how this has changed over time. This information is vital for anyone who wants to understand the current state of healthcare in the US and for those working towards improving the healthcare system.
