    "**What is the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and smoking status and their impact on an individual's medical expenses in the United States?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on analyzing the impact of body mass index (BMI) and smoking status on medical expenses in the US using the Medical Cost Personal Datasets from Kaggle. The analysis will involve cleaning and pre-processing the data, exploring the relationship between the variables using descriptive statistics and data visualization, running regression models to quantify the relationship, and performing subgroup analysis to identify demographic differences. The findings will shed light on the importance of prevention and early intervention in reducing healthcare costs associated with obesity and smoking."
