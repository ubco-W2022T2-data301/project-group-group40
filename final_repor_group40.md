## Introduction
Our group decided to investigate the factors contributing to high medical costs in the United States. We were particularly interested in understanding how medical expenditures were distributed across different regions and genders, whether having children was a factor, and how body mass index (BMI) and smoking status were related to medical expenses.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
During our exploratory data analysis, we examined the distribution of medical expenses, age, gender, region, and BMI. We also looked for any potential outliers or missing values in our dataset.

One of the key findings from our EDA was that medical expenses were heavily skewed to the right, indicating that a small percentage of individuals had much higher medical costs than the rest of the population. We also observed that BMI was positively correlated with medical expenses, which was not surprising given that individuals with higher BMI tend to have more health issues.

### Question 1: How are medical expenditures distributed across various regions and genders?
To answer this question, we created a series of scatterplots to examine the relationship between medical expenses, region, and gender. We found that medical expenses were generally higher for males than females, and that the Southeast region had the highest medical expenses overall.

### Question 2: Are children one of the underlying factors contributing to the high costs of healthcare in the United States?
To explore this question, we grouped individuals by the number of children they had and examined the distribution of medical expenses within each group. We found that individuals with more children tended to have slightly higher medical expenses than those with fewer children. However, this difference was relatively small and likely not a significant factor in the overall high costs of healthcare in the United States.

### Question 3: What is the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and smoking status and their impact on an individual's medical expenses in the United States?
To answer this question, we created a series of scatterplots and histograms to examine the relationship between BMI, smoking status, and medical expenses. We found that smokers tended to have much higher medical expenses than non-smokers, and that this effect was even more pronounced for individuals with higher BMI.

## Summary/Conclusion
Overall, our analysis suggests that factors such as gender, region, smoking status, and BMI are all important contributors to the high costs of healthcare in the United States. While having more children may be a factor, it is likely not a major contributor. Our findings underscore the importance of promoting healthy behaviors such as not smoking and maintaining a healthy BMI in order to reduce healthcare costs and improve overall health outcomes.
