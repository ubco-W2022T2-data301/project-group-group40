# Project Vision

Our goal is to provide a thorough and informative examination of medical spending in the United States. We hope to shed light on the significant determinants of medical expenditures and the variables influencing individual and family access to healthcare. Our objective is to utilize this information to develop a better knowledge of the US healthcare system and to motivate efforts to create a more fair and economic system for all. Our study will enlighten policymakers, healthcare providers, and consumers about the reality of medical spending in the United States and encourage evidence-based decision-making to enhance healthcare outcomes for all.
